## Preface
Frankly speaking, I'm not a guy with good sense of writing. More precisely, I am kinda of afraid when expressing my ideas via typing. If you are a friend of mine reading this, I am quite sure that you would laugh at it. How come a talktive guy in real life claiming to be shy online. Well, in my view, writing meaning recording, it may haunt my mind for quite a while if I post something unprecise or stupid. Haha, you get it, I could be reckless when speaking off the record, so don't blame me if you get wrongfuly fun facts from me as long as you have FUN! Back to the topic, I admire great writers who inspired people with appealing stories. As a developer, I benefit from other people's writings a lot, say tons of tutorials and good documendations. I am a deep believer in Open Source Software, to which I wish I could make contributions. For starters, If you are interested in source code of this website, you can always check my github [repo](https://github.com/daxia07/mui-blog "here"). For the record, I am going to take my words on this website seriously.

## Investor & Engineer
Obviously this website is very much blog-like, so the key issue is what to write. It took me quite a while to figure out a theme. Sharing? Sounds too plain. Info hub? Am I overestimating myself on high qualiy content production? At last, just consider it a playground for funny stories, ideas and projects! Topics on top of my mind are development and investment which have been my profession for more than two years. The combination may lead some creative thinking, or even a new philosophy to view things. __Think like an investor, and work like an engineer.__

<blockquote>"The first rule is that you’ve got to have multiple models — because if you just have one or two that you’re using, the nature of human psychology is such that you’ll torture reality so that it fits your models.. And the models have to come from multiple disciplines because all the wisdom of the world is not to be found in one little academic department."    ---By Charlie Munger

If you think like an investor, you will always keep Return on Investment on mind, and try to optimize your enery and resources on most rewarding projects. However, until now investment is generally regarded as kind of artistic even through people are driving modern scientific approaches to the market. Still, the market is quite unpredictable to both legend grand masters of investment and champion beater AI. Working as an engineer is quite a different experience. You collect infomation and resources at first, set up plans, fix problems and make substantial progress block by block. Compared to investors, engineers often have various ways to locate the potential error and try to adjust strategy. For example, a software engineer can trace error by system logs, and reproduce the situation. How about we combining these two descision models together?

A real-world example is how I built this website. 

At first, I can build the website in the old way like I used to with django, which saves time and learning time. Django is a python high-level framework for web development mostly run on the backend. It seems fair enough for a blog website, which remain static for most of cases. Acctually, this website is not merely meant for myself. I want my wife and my friends can have access to this Kṣetra, and feel free to interact in a private circle. So I need user authentication! Still no big deal, I can use django third-party packages to implement comment apps and so on. Then I will spend most of my time on database management, template adjustment and handling API calls. When it comes to the rich editor plugin, it could be a huge pain in the ass. If you use django package to deliver the editor plugin which is written in javascript, it slows down the page loading performance. If you use CDN, then you will have to learn how it works properly with your HTML DOM, css styles and APIs. Hey, it's year 2019, right? What's the most popular technique to render a fancy editor to page viewers? 

React! It's One Mintue Search answer with little confusion.

Then how to build a website with the state-of-art react tech?

MERN! Mongodb + Express + React + Node 

Well, it's 20-minute-search result with some confusion.

Then the question comes to, if I need to learn this stack when the learning curve seems intimidating. Is it __worthy__?

This is an investment decision I should make. I was waiting for my working visa when I quited my job in China to join my wife in Sydney. Last two years, I have been working with data and models when web development frameworks are growing in an amazing speed. If I don't catch up the trend, maybe I will never get to hop on in. For the long run, the ability to deliver a full-stack solution to meet small companies' need to go cyber can be a huge profitable business. We are already in a cloud epoch, there are so many XX-AS-Services out there, and many of them rely on javascript. I have found out that reading finanical reports can be a huge pain in the ass. To alleviate the pain, I should at least know how to let the computers do the heavy lifting jobs. Adding these new techinques to my skillset can help me write better web scrawlers, and present analytical results. It seems inevitable to learn the latest web development skills. After some investigation, the new solution to build a website come out. Third party services like Auth0, contentful, netlify, zeit and disqus will be used in authentication, CMS, hosting, API and comment modules. After all, __No need to reinvent the wheels!__ If learning a new skill opens the gate for the world of resources, there is no way to hold back!

## What contents in mind

In my plan, I will post some tutorials to build a gatsby website with the help of mutliple third-party service providers. I will try to explain my thoughts in the architecture designing process. It's not so hard as imagined, thanks to well organized documentation, open source community and Google. Besides, youtube videos and udemy can give you a less intimidating guidance. My second tutorial will be a chrome extension using scrapy to fetch data, and node server to manage data and provide API services. A online-shopping helper, quite practical, isn't it?
Beside development projects, I am going to try out some quant models and analyze results with real data. Maybe try some AI approaches later on.
Cooking is my wife's new habbit, so there will be a new column to share recipes and some nice pictures. I built a tool to search recipes, and extract ingredients, maybe later on I will connect the ingredients to the shopping helper.

## About me
My name is Mingxia, and I worked as a quantitative analysis in Shenzhen before I joined my wife in Sydeny four months ago. I have got a bachelor and master degree in information technology, so I do a lot of programming. Most recently, I was trying to catch up with the latest frontend techniques to make myself a qualified full-stack developer.

## One more thing
Special thanks to my wife Jingyi for your unconditional understanding and support. Just like the maybe-not-that-old saying, "every overseas student is a good chef". Feel free to checkout her creations in Cooking category.
